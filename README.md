# AdventOfCode-2023

This year I will do the Advent of Code in Typescript with [bun.sh](https://bun.sh).

The first step includes to run bun init to have a project.

The newly-improved calibration document consists of lines of text; each line originally contained a specific calibration value that the Elves now need to recover. On each line, the calibration value can be found by combining the first digit and the last digit (in that order) to form a single two-digit number.

For example:

``` text
1abc2       -> 1 2
pqr3stu8vwx -> 3 8
a1b2c3d4e5f -> 1 5
treb7uchet  -> 7
53abc1      -> 5 1
```

In this example, the calibration values of these four lines are 12, 38, 15, and 77. Adding these together produces 142.
